# longhand-converter

This program can be used to convert dollar amounts from number form to longhand text. For example, $1,234,511.89 would produce "one million two hundred thirty four thousand five hundred eleven and 89/100 dollars." Current inputs must start with a $ and not include commas. This will likely change in the future.
Also, enter numbers using the Scanner.
